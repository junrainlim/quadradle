# quadradle

A simple browser puzzle game based on [Latin Squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_square), built using Vue + Vite.

## Credits

Obtained the critical sets for latin squares of order 7 from https://people.smp.uq.edu.au/DianeDonovan/research/CSLS7_2.pdf.
Used SageMath's [Latin Squares](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/combinat/sage/combinat/matrices/latin.html) module to generate the latin square permutations, and their solutions.
